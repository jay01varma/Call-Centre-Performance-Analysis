# Call-Centre-Performance-Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
The **Call Centre Dashboard** is a Power BI project designed to provide actionable insights into the operations and performance of a call centre. By visualizing key metrics such as call volume, agent performance, customer satisfaction, and resolution times, this dashboard enables data-driven decision-making to improve overall efficiency and customer experience.

## Features
- **Call Volume Analysis**: Tracks daily, weekly, and monthly call volumes to identify peak hours and days.
- **Agent Performance**: Measures individual agent KPIs, including average handling time, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction scores.
- **Customer Feedback**: Visualizes customer sentiment trends and satisfaction ratings.
- **Resolution Time**: Highlights trends in first-call resolution and average resolution times.
- **Trend Analysis**: Compares historical data to detect patterns and anticipate operational demands.

## Objectives
- Improve call centre efficiency by identifying bottlenecks and performance gaps.
- Monitor and enhance agent performance.
- Optimize resource allocation during peak periods.
- Increase customer satisfaction by reducing resolution times and improving service quality.

## Data Sources
The dashboard leverages data from:
- **Call Logs**: Includes timestamps, call durations, and outcomes.
- **Agent Records**: Contains agent IDs, shift schedules, and performance metrics.
- **Customer Feedback**: Extracted from surveys and sentiment analysis tools.

## Key Metrics
- Total calls received, answered, and abandoned.
- Average Handling Time (AHT).
- First Call Resolution (FCR) rate.
- Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT).
- Call wait times and queue performance.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **SQL**: For data extraction and transformation.
